    <em class="font-bold">Rock Paper Scissors</em> is a hand game originating from China, usually 
  played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms 
  one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are <em class="font-bold">"Rock" </em>
  (a closed fist), <em class="font-bold">"Paper"</em> (a flat hand), and <em class="font-bold">"Scissors"</em> (a fist with the 
  index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is 
  identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") 
  except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.</p><br>

  <p class="item rounded shadow-lg bg-yellow-100 text-xl text-black text-center">
    A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. 
  A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors 
  ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), 
  but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
  a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
  If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually 
  immediately replayed to break the tie. The game spread from China while
  developing different variants in signs over time.</p><br>

   <p class="item rounded shadow-lg bg-yellow-100 text-xl text-black text-center">
    The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu[zh] 
    by the Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhe. who wrote that the game 
    dated back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE 220 CE).
    In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note
    of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling , 
    huozhitou, or huaquan.</p>
